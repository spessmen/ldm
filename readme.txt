 General docsite template for LDM and other projects

 This will be generated by a script when someone gets around to
 writing one.
 
 Help is appreciated as always, this is a community project.
 Hop on irc.rizon.net #spessmen, #coderbus, #vgstation, etc to
 find people working on this (and other DM projects).
